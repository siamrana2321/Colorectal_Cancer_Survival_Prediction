# Colorectal_Cancer_Survival_Prediction

**Project Overview**
This project aims to predict the survival status of colorectal cancer patients using machine learning. The model is trained on a dataset containing various patient attributes, such as age, gender, tumor stage, treatment history, and lifestyle factors. The trained model is deployed as a web application using Flask, allowing users to input patient data and receive a survival prediction.

**Features**
- Machine Learning Models: Utilizes multiple models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, etc.) for prediction.
- Web Application: A Flask-based web app for user interaction.
- Responsive UI: A clean and user-friendly interface for inputting patient data.
- Model Evaluation: Includes accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix for model performance analysis.

**Usage**
- Input Patient Data: Fill out the form with the patient's details, such as age, gender, tumor stage, treatment history, etc.

- Get Prediction: Click the "Predict" button to get the survival prediction (Survived or Deceased).

- View Results: The prediction result will be displayed on the screen.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project contains the following features:
- Patient Attributes: Age, Gender, Race, Region, Urban/Rural, Socioeconomic Status, etc.
- Medical History: Family History, Previous Cancer History, Stage at Diagnosis, Tumor Aggressiveness, etc.
- Lifestyle Factors: Diet Type, BMI, Physical Activity Level, Smoking Status, Alcohol Consumption, etc.
- Treatment Details: Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy, Surgery, Follow-Up Adherence, etc.
- Target Variable: Survival Status (Survived/Deceased).
